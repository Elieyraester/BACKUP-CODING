     <p>The three haeding above are aligned center,left and right.NCT is a South Korean boy group formed by S.M. Entertainment. Their name stands for the Hallyu localization project Neo Culture Technology, a term coined by S.M. Entertainment founder Lee Soo-man to describe the group’s concept of having an unlimited number of members divided into multiple sub-units based in various cities worldwide.I found out about NCT in the middle of 2020. I’m an EXO-L and I found out about them through SuperM. The first person to catch my attention was Mark because he called out Ellen (king shit) and they seemed like really funny and chill people. So I searched up about them (watched their funny moments first) but I really got into them when I heard their music.</p>
